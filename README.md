# Using the Nose for biometric authentication

An implementation of the feature extraction algorithms using spherical patches and nasal curves from the Gabor-wavelet normal maps.

## Getting started

Demo for Spherical Patches: ```Demo_spherical_patched.m```
Demo for Nasal Curves: ```Demo_nasal_curves_patched.m```

## Other appliations

Despite it is introduced for 3D face recognition, its applications can also be extended to other classes of 2D, 2.5D or 3D images, given a set of landmarks are available over the region.
